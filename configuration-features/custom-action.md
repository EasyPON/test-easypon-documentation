# Custom action

Custom action is a feature, which helps you to apply custom code to the ONU, that otherwise you have to do action by action. This simplifies any interaction with ONU and helps you to automate daily routine.\
The main difference between ONU preset and Custom action that ONU preset is using for register new ONU instead of creating actions that we needed.\
\
You may access custom action tab by clicking to the Preset / Action toggle in the right up corner of the [Preset list ](presets.md)page.&#x20;
