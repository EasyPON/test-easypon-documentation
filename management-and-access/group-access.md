# Group access

> The Group access section may not be displayed due to the limited access permissions of your account.

With group access, you can create rules to assign permissions to multiple users. Additionally, you have the option to grant individual users special permissions that override the permissions assigned to their respective groups.

## Standard permission groups

We added for you two standard groups with permissions, that are, for our opinion, suitable for admins and support managers. By the way, you can easily configure them by your own preferences.&#x20;

## Group creation

To add a group, you need to specify the name in the Name group input and the sections of access rights that will be activated in the group. If you need to set full access to the section, you need to activate the Full Access switch. If the rights are limited, then the group will have Partial Access and the necessary accesses must be set separately.

Permission groups can be assigned while creating or editing users on the user account creation or editing form.

The permission group can not be deleted if it is assigned at least to one user account. All the permission group changes when edited are automatically applied to the users with this group chosen. If the group is not chosen for the user, only his individual permissions will be active and need to be configured separately for each such user.

## Viewing group

After clicking the View button, a page with information about the selected group of access rights is displayed in the Group list table. On this page, you can edit the group name and access rights or delete the selected group.

The Group access section displays information about already existing permission groups and allows their creation, editing, and deletion in the EasyPON system.
