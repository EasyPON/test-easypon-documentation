### Quick Actions Bar

The user data page displays the buttons Back - return to the User list and Deactivate - deactivation of the user account in the system. After deactivation, the user will be blocked and will not be able to use the EasyPON system.

## User creation

The 'Create user' form presents fields for completion. In order for the user to have access to system operations, you can assign them group permissions or customize their permissions in the 'Special permissions' section.

* Group - the permission group assigned to the user. You can read more on [Group access](https://app.archbee.com/docs/TzlFsLikA7TqxqriFHwd8/Im7vwaMN7zMOZSwvWoA5y) in the appropriate section.
* Individual permissions for the user - individual user permissions. Individual user permissions have higher priority status over permission groups.

## Editing a user

The edit form allows you to change details of the user, such as their password and permissions, categorized by either group or personal preferences.

You can assign a group to a user and provide them with special permissions by granting access in the "special permissions" sector. These permissions will take precedence over the permissions assigned to their group, but assigned already group permissions will not be excluded.
