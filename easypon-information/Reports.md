# Reports

The report section within EasyPON has been designed to allow you to download data in XSLX format for your personal use. You have the flexibility to download any information from the table, regardless of whether it has been filtered or not. Generating a comprehensive report based on your selection may require some time for the system to process. However, you will receive a notification once the report is ready, and the action button will become active, enabling you to proceed with the download.

## ONU list section case

Download generated reports from the ONU list section. The reports are generated in electronic table format:

Reports can be generated by applying filters to the ONU list, pressing the Export to XSLX button, and confirming report generating process
