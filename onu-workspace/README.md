# 5âƒ£ ONU workspace

This workspace allows you to manage your network units: make changes, configure it, find it on the map and simply use the monitoring features.

You have [Find ONU](onu-search.md) tool in the main menu section where you can manage to find ONU by MAC address or serial number or even the MAC address of client's device.

To [register an ONU](onu-registration.md), just locate a new ONU in the red panel. If the configuration has already been added to the [Preset list](../configuration-features/presets.md), you can easily apply it on this step.

You can get monitoring information on the [detailed ONU page](onu.md) by clicking to any View button on the [All ONU page](all-onu.md). \
